  <h1 class="noUnderscore">The ACT, or DIE. League: Constitution</h1>

  <h2>[1.0 League Overview]</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the ACT, or DIE. Dynasty League. This is a 12-team league that was formed mid-season in 2018 for our more dedicated fantasy football playing friends as a place to compete against each other in a challenging and long-term setting. This is a dynasty league, meaning that owners will keep ALL the players on their team from year to year. This league is considered a prize money league, and all owners are expected to pay their league fee before the league fee deadline (start of the NFL regular season). There may be a late fee assessed after the deadline. This league is designed to be a competitive league between friends but is not a cut-throat league where anything goes. The rules described below are designed to act as a guideline for overall league play, and any disputes will be determined by the executive committee of the league. Please remember that the overall goal of this league is to have fun and enjoy the game of football with your friends. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>

  <h3>[1.1 Executive Committee]</h3>
  <p>The executive committee will be responsible for resolving all disputes that are not expressly covered by this constitution. If a committee member is involved in the dispute, that member will excuse themselves from the decision process. While all owners are encouraged to submit suggestions to the committee, the committee's decision on all matters is final. The executive committee will consist of the commissioner, Aaron Murnan, and three other team owners that will be elected before the draft each year. The committee is bound to adhere from ruling in favor of their own interests, but rather to rule inline with rules as written in this document and with overall fair play.</p>
  <p>The executive committee for the ACT or Die-Nasty League for 2021 consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Commissioner: Aaron Murnan​​​​​​440.371.7129</li>
    <li>Co-Commissioner/Treasurer: Lee Trask   ​​​​920.221.6040</li>
    <li>Co-Commissioner/Director of Rule Proposals: Cyres Cooper​ ​937.631.4074</li>
    <li>Co-Commissioner/Director of Draft Preparation: Lyndsey McMath ​330.407.4349​​</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[1.2 Living Constitution]</h3>
  <p>It is important to note that this is a living constitution that will change and evolve over the lifetime of this league. Changes will happen between seasons and will be effective from that point moving forward. A thread will be maintained in the league slack chat to allow rule proposals to be published all year. During the offseason, the executive committee will compile these proposals and all owners will vote on proposed changes to the constitution / league rules. The executive committee will attempt to keep a living document throughout each season so that if items are suggested during the year, these propositions can be kept track of. Further, revisions necessary to provide additional clarity may also be implemented between seasons for instances in which there is confusion.</p>

  <h2>[2.0 League Financing]</h2>
  <p>The league fee for the ACT, or DIE. League will be charged to each team owner, to be transferred to the league Treasurer before the annual ACT rookie draft (Lee Trask). If a team owner does not have the appropriate entry fee paid by the deadline, the executive committee may inflict monetary penalties that will increase in severity the longer the fee is tardy. If the league fee is not paid by 48 hours following the draft, the team in default may be seized by the executive committee and a new owner will be found. If a new owner cannot be found in time for the start of week 1, the executive committee will select that teams’ draft picks while still searching for a replacement owner. Hopefully this will never be a problem.</p>

  <h3>[2.1 League Fee]</h3>
  <p>The league fee for each season will be $100 from each owner. In each year (starting in the 2022 season), the annual league dues will increase by $10 per year. Therefore, dues over the next few years are as follows: 2022-$110; 2023-$120; 2024-$130; 2025-$140; 2026-$150; 2027 - $160; 2028 - $170; 2029 - $180; etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Super Pot</strong>- Each Year 15% of all league dues collected will be saved and rolled over for “the Super Pot”. “The Super Pot” will occur every 5 seasons and the payouts will pull from all dues collected in that season as well as the 15% set aside in EACH of the prior 4 seasons. Currently the 2022; 2023; 2024; 2025 seasons will each have 15% of their total collected dues set aside and that amount will be added to all the dues collected for the 2026 season. Good luck to everyone with your 5-year plan.</p>
  <p>Since total league dues available will fluctuate year to year all payouts are expressed using a % of total dues available to pay out that year. The % is commensurate to the percentage of total dues from the original breakdown of payouts (EX: $100 dollars to the losers bracket title is now 8.3% of league dues available -&gt; $100 / $1200 = 8.3%)</p>
  <p>The executive committee has elected to use the “Sleeper” platform as opposed to other dynasty-friendly formats such as myfantasyleague.com to save the $70 hosting fee and have more money for the prizes. Prize payout below.</p>

  <h3>[2.2 Prizes]</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The amount remaining following the purchase of the divisional prizes, trophy nameplate updates, end of year awards, and payouts for 2nd and 3rd place will be allocated to the 1st place team. The champion will also be awarded the rotating trophy to possess until the crowning of the following season’s champion.</li>
    <li>Second place receives 12.5% of league due available.</li>
    <li>3rd place receives 1X entry fee – 8.3% of dues available.</li>
    <li>Division winners will receive nice booze that corresponds with their respective division. <em>No more than $50 can be spent on a single bottle</em></li>
    <li>Any fines inflicted and collected by the executive committee will be added to the following year’s prize money.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>*The rotating trophy will be returned to the commissioner prior to beginning of the following year’s playoffs. This will allow the exec committee to fashion the new name plate and get the trophy to its new owner in a reasonable time frame.</em></p>
  <p><em>*Mailing the trophy will be extremely discouraged as to avoid damages to the trophy*</em></p>
  <p><em>*If for some reason you damage the trophy or lose the trophy you will be responsible for replacing the league trophy*</em></p>

  <h3>[2.2.1 End of Year Awards]</h3>
  <p><strong>Rookie of The Year</strong> - 3.3% of league dues available. This end of year award will reward the team that makes the “best rookie draft pick”. This award will be given to the owner who drafts the highest scoring skill position player (WR/RB/TE) in the rookie draft. Players who are selected as devy players will be excluded from qualification. Players traded are not exempt. The purpose of the award is to reward the best selection made, so if you draft the winning player in the 3rd round and trade them pre-season or in season, the team that originally drafted that player will win the award. Scores for this award will be calculated as total points scored between Week 1 and Championship Week (Week 17) for all rookies except QBs.</p>
  <p><strong>The Gump Hayes Award (Best Waiver Wire Add)</strong> – 3.3% of league dues available: This award will be given to the team with the “Best waiver wire pickup” at the end of the year. The winner will be determined by which waiver wire accrued the most points for their owner (both in the starting lineup/ and the bench) on weeks for which they were on the active roster. Waiver wire pick ups no longer continue to accrue points after being dropped or traded for their original team; but will begin accruing points for their new team. Scores for this award will be calculated as total points scored between Week 1 and Championship Week (Week 17). Unlike the ROY award, QBs are eligible to win the Waiver Wire Add of the Year Award aka the Gump Hayes award.</p>
  <p><strong>Executive Committee Discretionary Fund</strong> – 3.3% of league dues available will be allocated to an Executive Committee Discretionary Fund (each year, starting in 2023). The executive committee will use these funds for anything that may come up such as new trophy needs, incentives to take over an abandoned team, draft day special item, etc. This money will be tracked by the treasurer (Lee Trask) the same way all other funds are tracked and the executive committee will only use discretionary funds for things that better the league.</p>

  <h3>[2.3. Comical League Penalty]</h3>
  <p>The last place team is to complete the ACT some time between the end of the season and the annual rookie draft. The league pot will cover the entry fees for the ACT, but it is the responsibility of the last place finisher to sign up and complete the test. [2021] For any owner who loses in consecutive years, that owner may take an alternative examination (such as the SAT) instead of the ACT. Any alternative examination must be discussed and approved by the executive committee prior to. Any professional examination that is furthering the professional development or is required for an owner’s profession will not be allowed to replace the ACT. For any owner not in compliance or whom refuses to complete the penalty, a league vote will be held to decide whether or not they should be permitted to remain in the league. For those who are permitted to remain in the league, a penalty will be inflicted upon their team. This penalty will be in the form of forfeiture of that team’s first round rookie draft pick. For non-compliant teams that do not have ownership of their 1st round pick for that draft, the executive committee will develop a punishment of equal value. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE EVENT OF WORST-CASE SCENARIO, THE EXPECTATION IS THAT ANY LAST PLACE TEAM WILL COMPLETE THE PUNISHMENT AND WE WILL NEVER NEED TO VOTE TO REMOVE THEM OR FORFEIT THEIR DRAFT PICKS.</p>

  <h2>[3.0 League Setup and Competition]</h2>
  <p>The ACT, or DIE. League will consist of 12 teams, broken into 3 divisions of 4 teams each. The schedule will be randomly generated so that any one team will play everyone in its own division twice and everyone in the other divisions once. This results in a 14-week regular season.</p>
  <p>Each team will have the opportunity to be awarded up to 2 wins each week (28 total games). 1) Every week your team will play against another team head-to-head, the team with the most points will be awarded a WIN and the team with less points will be awarded a LOSS. 2) Each week, the highest six scoring teams (top half) will be awarded an additional WIN whereas the six lowest scoring teams on the week will be awarded a LOSS.</p>
  <p>Every 3 years the divisions will be realigned and new prizes can be discussed. The three teams with the best cumulative record (see Section 3.1) from the past 3 years will get to select the divisions. The team with the best 3-yr W/L record will select first, followed by the team with the 2nd best  3-yr best records and so on. This re-alignment draft will be a snake draft. The inaugural year, divisions were determined by favorite boozes.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This allows for rivalries to develop within the divisions over the 3-year period, but also allows opportunities to restore balance across divisions when disparity arises. It also gives the best teams a opportunity strategize in their selection of divisions, which should help ensure teams are equally balanced out. Some may want weaker teams so a playoff spot is easier to earn. Some may want tougher teams so that a good team could get squeezed out of the playoffs. Some may want to continue their rivalries. Some may be sick and tired of playing a team twice a year for 3 years.</p>
  <p>If the NFL reschedules a game or games for ANY reason, the statistics from those games will count for the week in which the game is actually played. If this were to happen after the rosters lock at 1pm on Sunday, you would receive zero points that week for the players involved in the rescheduled game. If the game is canceled entirely, players involved will function as if they have a bye (they can be moved into and out of the lineup, but will obviously not accrue any points and can only be switched with players from the bench that are not locked).</p>

  <h3>[3.1 Rankings]</h3>
  <p>During the regular season – each team will play another team head-to-head each week.</p>
  <p>Teams will be ranked both overall and within divisions based on the following criteria:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Team Record: wins and losses</li>
    <li>Highest total points scored</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>[3.2 Playoffs]</h3>
  <p>The playoffs will be weeks 15, 16 &amp; 17. These will consist of both the championship bracket (5 teams), as well as potential tie-breaking playoffs for draft position.</p>

  <h3>[3.2.2 Championship Bracket Playoff Seeding]</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Teams will be seeded following week 14 as follows…
      <ul>
        <li>Division winners will each receive a playoff bid, as will two additional wild card teams</li>
        <li>Among division winners, overall ranking will determine seeding 1-3 in the tournament</li>
        <li>The two teams with the best records, who do not win their respective division will each receive a playoff bid as a wild card team (overall points will tie-break amongst wild card bids with same record)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The #4 and #5 seeds will play a wild card game in week 15 to determine who will advance to play the #1 seed in week 16</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[3.2.3 Championship bracket]</h3>
  <h4>Week 15 Championship Bracket</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Wild card Game: Seeds #4 &amp; #5</li>
    <li>Loser of Wild Card will be awarded Pick 8 in the following Rookie Draft.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Week 16 Championship Bracket</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Game 1: Seed #1 &amp; the winner of the wild card Game</li>
    <li>Game 2: Seeds #2 &amp; #3</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Week 17 Championship Bracket</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Championship Game: Winner of Game 1 vs Winner of Game 2
      <ul>
        <li>WINNER=LEAGUE CHAMP – receives 1st place prize money &amp; pick 12 in next annual draft</li>
        <li>Loser is runner up – receives 2nd place prize money &amp; pick 11 in next annual draft</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>3rd Place Game: Loser of Game 1 vs Loser of Game 2
      <ul>
        <li>Winner receives 3rd place prize money &amp; pick 10 in next Annual draft</li>
        <li>Loser receives zero prize money &amp; pick 9 in next Annual draft</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[3.2.4 Playoff Tiebreaker Bracket]</h3>
  <p>As per the league vote the number one option for deciding draft order was a simple wins &amp; losses. That is to say that those with worse records get worse draft picks - followed by least points scored for the season to break record ties.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the worst record in the league weeks 1-14 will receive the #1 rookie pick, second worst will receive the #2 rookie pick and so on and so forth. Where there are record ties among multiple owners (excluding playoff teams whose draft order will be sorted out in the playoff bracket) points scored will be utilized to break ties. Less points scored will correspond to better draft picks.</p>

  <h3>[3.2.5 - Loser’s Playoff Bracket]</h3>
  <p>A loser’s bracket will be hosted for the 7 teams that do not make playoffs starting week 15. The loser’s bracket champion determined by the above process will be awarded a compensatory draft pick between the end of round 1 and the beginning of round 2 (Pick 1.13). This pick (like any other asset) can be traded as an asset. Playoff ordering will be best record at the top. 7 teams will be in the loser’s bracket, with the number one seed (first team to not make the championship bracket), receiving a week 15 bye.</p>
  <p>Since sleeper does not currently have a setting or functionality to permit this type of rule; the executive committee will work together to create a process to build this into our draft that is easy to understand and reduces burden on all drafters. We will also connect with sleeper support about whether they can create this functionality for us or advise on best practices to support this rule.</p>
  <p>Starting in the 2025-2026 season, the Loser’s Bracket Winner will only win the compensatory pick and will no longer be awarded the 8.3% prize money.</p>

  <h2>[4.0 Rosters]</h2>
  <p>Rosters in the ACT, or DIE. League consist of an Active Roster, a Taxi Squad, and an Injured Reserve.</p>
  <p>The active roster will consist of up to 25 active players from any NFL team. There are no position limits, and owners are free to have as many players from any position as they like. Only players from the active roster may be used as part of a team's weekly starting lineup. The Taxi Squad will consist of up to 5 players. These players must be rookies, 2nd year players, or 3rd year players. See Section 4.3 for more detail. The injured reserve will consist of up to 4 players that are listed on the NFL’s official IR/PUP list.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Suspended players may not be placed on the IR roster.</li>
    <li>The active roster will be temporarily increased to 27 during the offseason. The exact date of the temporary roster expansion will be announced by the commissioner sometime shortly after the NFL Super Bowl.</li>
    <li>All players must be removed from the IR roster before the offseason Blind Bidding Free Agency period and returned to the temporarily expanded active roster or be dropped to the free agent pool. If there are still players on the IR at the start of the offseason free agency period, those players will automatically be dropped by the commissioner.</li>
    <li>Players on the Taxi Squad may remain there at the owner’s discretion (as long as they do not violate the rules of the Taxi Squad as outlined in section 4.3), and will not count against the 27 player active roster limit during the offseason.</li>
    <li>The active roster must be cut down to 25 no later than 1 day before the first Week 1 NFL regular season game.</li>
    <li>The executive committee may distribute a monetary penalty for noncompliance of any of these rules (after ample warning and pestering)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[4.1.1 The Inaugural Draft]</h3>
  <p>There will be an inaugural draft including 2018 rookies and veteran players. This will function similarly to a standard redraft league. Draft position in the inaugural draft will be chosen via a pick’em competition. The first place finisher will have their choice of what position to draft from. Each subsequent owner will be able to choose their draft position accordingly. The last team selected by the lottery will have whichever draft position is left. The draft will be a slow draft held online by the hosting site. At the time of each pick, the owner will have 8 hours to make and submit their selection through the website. The timer for each pick will be paused at 10pm EST and continue counting down at 10am EST the following morning. The draft will continue as normal through weekends. The countdown for each pick will begin immediately after the previous pick has been made. If a selection is not made when the timer expires, the system will automatically select the highest ranked player on the “My Draft List”. If the “My Draft List” is empty, the pick will simply be skipped and the owner will receive no compensation. The inaugural draft will be a snake draft and will consist of 30 rounds. The players selected in the inaugural draft will serve as the 25 player roster for the 2018 season. After the inaugural draft, all yearly rules will become immediately effective (Taxi Squad moves, IR, trades, roster cut deadlines, etc). Following the draft you may only have 25 players on your roster therefore 5 must be moved to your taxi squad immediately following the draft. NO TRADING will be allowed of the inaugural draft picks. See Section 4.5 for more details.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> the Inaugural Draft will likely take 2-3 weeks. You have been warned.</p>

  <h3>[4.1.2 The Annual Draft]</h3>
  <p>The inaugural draft will be completed prior to the end of the 2018 fantasy football season. The draft will be a 30-round, snaking, slow draft completed over email or the site application and will not require your full attention. The draft will likely take a total of 2-3 weeks to complete. While this may seem strange for folks coming from redraft, this is pretty status quo and is truly the most optimal format for completing these long dynasty drafts.</p>
  <p>After the inaugural year, there will be an annual draft consisting of all rookie players. This will likely take place during the offseason. It will be a straight-line draft in the order determined by the previous year’s playoff results. The annual rookie draft will be 4 rounds in total. To keep the draft moving, each team will have 3 minutes to make their selections in round 3 and 4. No timer will be applied to round 1 and 2 in the spirit of having fun and allow teams to maximize their utilization of these assets.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Draft picks may not be used to go over your roster space, you must drop players or have available spaces to roster draft picks. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of the draft pick and no compensatory pick will be offered in return.</p>

  <h3>[4.2 Annual Draft Order]</h3>
  <p>The annual draft order will be determined by the final standings from the previous year (as determined by the results of the playoff brackets). Standings are determined by team record and points scored between Weeks 1 and 14 for Consolation Bracket Participants. For Playoff Bracket participants, draft order will be determined by outcome of the Playoff Bracket games. See the table below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick 1: Worst Record</li>
    <li>Pick 2: 2nd Worst record</li>
    <li>Pick 3: 3rd worst record</li>
    <li>Pick 4: 4th worst record</li>
    <li>Pick 5: 5th worst record</li>
    <li>Pick 6: 6th worst record</li>
    <li>Pick 7: 7th worst record</li>
    <li>Pick 8: Loser of the wild card playoff game</li>
    <li>Pick 9: Week 16 loser of the 3rd &amp; 4th place game in the Playoff Bracket.</li>
    <li>Pick 10: 3rd Place</li>
    <li>Pick 11: 2nd Place (League Runner Up)</li>
    <li>Pick 12: 1st Place (League Champion)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[4.3 Taxi Squad]</h3>
  <p>The Taxi Squad will consist ONLY of active NFL Rookies, 2nd year players, or 3rd year players. Each team is allowed 5 Taxi Squad positions. Players acquired during any of the offseason activities (annual draft, offseason free agency, etc), must be placed on the Taxi Squad no later than 1 day before the Week 1 game of the NFL regular season if they are to remain there for the duration of the season. A player may be promoted from the Taxi Squad to the Active Roster at any time; however, once a player is on the Active Roster, they may not be demoted to the Taxi Squad again until the following offseason (provided they still qualify). Promoting a player from the Taxi Squad cannot violate roster maximums (ie: must have open roster spot or drop a player in order to promote). If not placed on the Taxi Squad by the deadline, qualifying players will be considered part of the Active Roster and therefore cannot be placed onto the Taxi Squad until the next offseason. Taxi Squad spots are not required to be filled.</p>
  <p>Players that qualify may be added to the Taxi Squad mid-season via free agency. The system does not allow direct addition of Free Agents to the Taxi Squad; therefore, the player must first be added to the Active Roster and then demoted to the Taxi Squad immediately. If the newly added player is not demoted to the Taxi Squad by the start of any games for that week, he will be considered part of the Active Roster and will not be eligible for the Taxi Squad until the following year. Every owner is responsible for monitoring this and the Executive Committee/Commissioner will have final say if there are any discrepancies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Taxi Squad players are not permitted to be traded at any time; they must first be promoted to the Active Roster to become a tradable commodity. Taxi Squad moves are NOT allowed during the annual or inaugural draft. (ie: Cannot place a player on Taxi Squad during draft in order to use all available draft picks).</li>
    <li>Suspended players may not be placed on the Taxi Squad at any time. If a player is already on the Taxi Squad and then becomes suspended, he may remain there until the next offseason, at which point he must be moved to the active roster or dropped. The Executive Committee will have final say if there are discrepancies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the season, ANY owner may “sign” a player from ANY other owner’s Taxi Squad by posting a notification on the leagues slack thread – at which point the exec committee will also notify the owner who has a player being claimed. The owner of the player will then have 72 hours to decide if they want to promote the player to their active roster or forfeit him. The owner making the claim must provide compensation for “signing away” the Taxi Squad player. Compensation will be in the form of a draft pick in the next year’s Annual Draft, equal to ONE round higher than the player was originally drafted (minimum cost of a rookie 3rd round pick). If a player was drafted in the 1st round, compensation will be a 1st and 2nd round draft pick. If a player went undrafted in the annual draft, compensation will be a 3rd round pick. To make a claim, you must own a pick in that round for the next annual draft (or designate a higher round pick). If multiple picks are owned in that round then the owner losing their player may choose which pick they want. A player claimed from a Taxi Squad must be placed on the new teams Active Roster. The Commissioner’s discretion will be used in disputes regarding adequate time to acknowledge the claim attempt in relation to the 72 hours and personal vacation/away schedules (don’t try to screw someone if you know they will be without internet for a few days…). Taxi squad claims may not be revoked, waived or rescinded once the second owner accepts the claim OR following the 72 hour window. An owner accepting a claim includes that owner communicating in the league group thread, communicating to the 1st owner, or any of the exec board members that they are accepting the claim. Prior to an accepted claim or time expiring on the 72 hour clock (whichever comes first), the withdrawal of a taxi claim is permitted.</p>
  <p><strong>Raeger Rule</strong> – a player who is dropped to waivers and then picked up as a free agent has their taxi claim cost updated to a 3rd round pick and loses their taxi claim cost associated with their original draft capital upon being dropped. The Raeger Rule does not apply to trades, only when players are dropped and then acquired by a new team and placed on that team’s taxi squad in line with appropriate taxi squad additions and protocol.</p>
  <p>Players that have been promoted from the Taxi Squad to the Active Roster can only be returned to the Taxi Squad the following year during the off-season, provided they still qualify.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> this ONLY applies for players on the Taxi Squad. Players on any teams’ IR cannot be claimed in this way. Players on any team’s active roster cannot be claimed in this way.</p>
  <p><strong>Additional Note: (2019)</strong> Any player placed on the IR prior to week 1 of the regular season, is eligible to be placed on the taxi squad mid-season when they are removed from the NFL IR list (only for players otherwise eligible under taxi squad rules). Players promoted from IR to active roster lose their eligibility for taxi squad, they must be directly moved from IR to taxi.</p>
  <p><strong>Note: (2019)</strong> Teams making taxi squad claims for a player for whom they lack the correct compensatory pick to claim will be required to pay a rookie pick 1 round higher. If that pick is not available it will require a rookie round pick higher and so forth.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Players “year in the league” will update immediately after the fantasy season. Therefore, if you have a 3rd year player on your taxi squad you must move them to your active roster immediately after the season when the “off-season” commences. This was decided not by us, but by Sleeper. Sleeper updates year in the league relatively quickly post-season, making some taxi squad illegal.</p>

  <h3>[4.4 Free Agency]</h3>
  <p>Free agents will be acquired in two ways: Blind Bidding, and First Come First Serve acquisition.</p>
  <h4>[4.4.1] Blind Bidding Dollars</h4>
  <p>Each team will receive 1500 Bidding Dollars after the inaugural draft and after each annual Draft. There is no rollover of Bidding Dollars.</p>
  <h4>[4.4.2] In-season:</h4>
  <p>Blind Bid Free Agency will occur every week during the NFL season starting when the league is rolled over to the new year on Sleeper. During the season, bids (using the 1500 bidding dollars allotted after each annual draft) will be submitted through the host site and processed on Wednesdays. This should give everyone plenty of time to submit their bids on Tuesday and Wednesday during the season. Players that were dropped from other teams will be locked until the following week so that every owner has a fair chance to bid/acquire all free agents.</p>
  <p>First Come First Served acquisitions will begin after waiver run after the blind bids are processed. They will remain open until Sundays at 1:00pm. Players added/dropped in this way do not cost any bidding dollars.</p>

  <h3>[4.5 Trades]</h3>
  <p>Trading is allowed and highly encouraged in The ACT, or DIE. League, and may be conducted between any owners. Trades may include multiple players from any position, as well as draft picks in the next annual Draft, the next, next draft and the next, next, next annual draft (3 years out), and Blind Bid Dollars. Trades may not exceed roster limits. (If a trade will exceed the roster limit, then a player(s) must be dropped to accommodate the roster limit). All trade activity will be closed during regular season game play (when the players are actually on the field)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trading will open directly after the inaugural draft.</li>
    <li>No trades will be allowed after Week 14 of the fantasy football season.</li>
    <li>Trades will resume after the League Championship Game, and remain open during the offseason.</li>
    <li>Trades are allowed during the annual draft. If the trade involves the draft pick that is currently on the clock, the countdown timer WILL NOT be reset. The new owner of the pick will have the remaining time to make their selection.</li>
    <li>Unlike Taxi Squad players, IR players may be traded directly from their IR roster spot. However, that player must go to an open roster spot on the receiving teams Active Roster. Once the trade has occurred, the new owner may then move that player to his IR if there is an open spot.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>[2021] Developmental assets are not permitted to be traded during any of the annual rookie/developmental drafts.</p>

  <h4>[4.5.1 Trade Veto]</h4>
  <p>All trades will occur instantaneously upon their acceptance on the host site. The executive committee reserves the right to retroactively reverse any trade that they deem inconsistent with league competition and fair-play standards. Everyone values players/picks differently and everyone in this league has enough football knowledge to determine their own “fair value”. This veto will only be invoked in extreme cases where it is obvious that one owner is trying to give another owner an unfair advantage (i.e. collusion). The owners in question may offer reasons why the trade should be allowed, but the decision of the executive committee is final once it has been rendered. If the trade involves a committee member, they may offer reasons for the trade to be allowed but will not have a say in the final committee decision. As previously stated, the executive committee will not base their decisions on what is best for their team (ex: one team becoming too good) and will only be focused on determining if “collusion” or foul play has occurred.</p>

  <h4>[4.5.2 Explicit ban on rental-trades]</h4>
  <p>All rental trades including but not limited to: seller’s remorse clause, end of season trade backs or temporarily rentals are strictly prohibited. A rental trade is considered any trade that involves one team trading a player or asset to another team for a specified period of time in exchange for compensation. Any such deal will be vetoed or reversed by the executive board. Any such deal that is made in secret of the remainder of the league and is in spirit a rental trade will be subject to collusion by-laws and potential expulsion.</p>

  <h3>[4.6 Starting Lineups]</h3>
  <p>Starting lineups in ACT, or DIE. League are designed to be flexible, allowing teams to build competitive rosters in different ways. There will be 10 starters in the 2022 season. Please see * below for upcoming changes within the 2023 season.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 quarterback</li>
    <li>2 running back</li>
    <li>2 wide receivers</li>
    <li>1 tight end</li>
    <li>1 Flex (RB/WR/TE)</li>
    <li>1 Reception Flex (WR/TE) [2026-2027 this position will transition into a ‘Full Flex’ (RB/WR/TE)]</li>
    <li>1 Super Flex (QB/RB/WR/TE)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players may be added or removed from the starting lineup up until the start of their game. Players are locked in or out at the start of their game.</p>
  <p><em>*Each team is allotted one ‘Player Swap’ option through Sleeper Functionality, for more details on what a ‘Player Swap’ is, please see instructions and policies outlined on Sleeper’s Website or their application.</em></p>

  <h4>[4.6.1 Position Designations]</h4>
  <p>From time to time, the NFL may change their designation of a particular player from one position to another or a player may line up in multiple positions throughout the game. For example, a wide receiver may be switched to a tight end and vice versa. For the purposes of the ACT, or DIE. League, a player will have only the designation that the host site gives him. If you feel as though your player is mis-categorized per other league formats, you can bring this up and the executive committee will provide a final ruling.</p>

  <h3>[4.7 Developmental Players &amp; Picks-“Devy”]</h3>
  <p>This league was formally a devy league; however, the option to draft devy assets during the rookie draft is no longer available.</p>
  <p>Devy assets that are already owned can be traded as owners see fit.</p>

  <h3>[4.8 Active Ownership Requirements]</h3>
  <p>Each owner is expected to actively manage their team each week, even if they are eliminated from any playoff consideration.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Owners must submit a lineup each week, even if their lineup is the same as the previous week.</li>
    <li>Owners who do not submit a complete lineup for a week, will have this week counted as one week of “inactivity”.</li>
    <li>If an owner does not submit a complete lineup for 2 consecutive weeks or accumulates 4+ total weeks of “inactivity” in any one season, the executive committee will have the right to assume control of the team and manage it for the rest of the season to ensure complete lineups are set.
      <ul>
        <li>A committee run team may not make any trades and is only allowed to add or drop players if the team cannot field a legal starting lineup due to injury or bye weeks. A league vote at the end of the season will determine if the original owner will be allowed to retain their team the following year or if a new owner should be found.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Missed deadlines (roster cuts, paying league dues, returning IR players to roster, etc) may incur monetary fines as well as count as a week of “inactivity”.</li>
    <li>The Commissioner and/or the Executive Committee will attempt to contact any inactive owners via email, text, or phone to issue a notification of and warning against their “inactivity” each time that it occurs. If the team is in danger of being seized by the executive committee, the inactive owner will be explicitly warned of this repercussion in the email/text/call.</li>
    <li>Hopefully this never becomes an issue, but these are the guidelines if it does.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[4.9 Owner replacement]</h3>
  <p>While we hope to avoid this, if an owner decides to step away from the league, the executive committee will be responsible for finding a replacement owner. The owner exiting the league will not be able to pass their team off to a person of their choice or sell their team. Exec committee will find a new owner.</p>

  <h3>[4.10 Anti – Tanking Provision]</h3>
  <p>The ACT, or DIE-Nasty League is a competitive league, created for the league owners to have fun playing fantasy football. While competitive, this is not a cut-throat league. In the spirit of competition and league fairness, owners are not allowed to intentionally create a legal starting lineup that gives the opposing team a clear advantage. The executive committee reserves the right to step in and adjust the starting lineup of a team that is clearly trying to intentionally lose a game. If the committee must adjust a team's lineup in two consecutive weeks or for three or more weeks in any one season, the team will be considered inactive and the executive committee may assume ownership of the team as detailed in Sec. 4.7.</p>
  <p>In any week that a team submits an incomplete lineup, they will be eligible to have their incomplete roster submission reviewed by the executive committee. The executive committee will have the authority to move that teams’ rookie 1st round pick back one spot, per incomplete roster submission. The executive committee will not be permitted to enforce such a punishment if that team’s 1st round pick is owned by another player. The executive committee’s decision to penalize a team or not penalize a team for an incomplete roster submission will be informed by the impact of that incomplete roster upon the draft ordering AND the intention / circumstances of the team determined by the committee meeting with that owner. The executive committee’s decision to enforce a penalty for one week or multiple weeks under this policy does not impact or alter any penalty associated with setting 3 incomplete roster submissions across a season or back to back incomplete roster submission within a season (see above paragraph in section 4.10).</p>
  <p>However, this is not to say that the executive committee frowns upon strategic tanking, owners will not be obstructed from “blowing up” their roster and attempting to rebuild. These rules are less to do with your choice to tank and more to ensure fairness in the league. When you intentionally lose, you give another team an unearned win that may profoundly impact playoff seeding etc.</p>

  <h2>[5.0 Scoring System]</h2>
  <p>Scoring in ACT, or DIE. League will be computed to 2 decimal places. This will allow points to be awarded or deducted for every positive or negative play. Decimal scoring will dramatically reduce the chance for a tie game. Points are only awarded to players in the starting lineup.</p>

  <h3>[5.1.1 General Scoring]</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 pts per Passing TD</li>
    <li>6 pts per All Other TD</li>
    <li>0.04 pts per Passing Yard</li>
    <li>0.1 pts per Rushing Yard</li>
    <li>0.1 pts per Receiving Yard</li>
    <li>0.5 pts per Receptions</li>
    <li>2 pts per Scored 2 pt Conversion (Thrown, Rushed, or Received)</li>
    <li>-2 pts per Fumble Lost</li>
    <li>-2 pts per Interception Thrown</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>[5.1.2. League Parlay Chef’s Table Addendum]</h3>
  <p>Beginning in the 2025-2026 season, each week the lowest scoring team will place a $5 parlay bet, any potential winnings of which will then be divided equally among the 12 teams in the league. Each week, each team will have the opportunity to add one leg to league parlay. Parlay legs will be added into a specific parlay legs chat in the Slack. Teams will have up until Saturday night to submit their parlay legs and the lowest scoring team from the week prior will have until 1pm to submit the parlay. In the event of a substantial winning, the team that placed the bet will be allowed to hold the funds until they pay taxes on their winnings and then equally allocate the remaining amount after taxes. We ask you all to bare with the league and executive committee as we find a smooth rhythm to this in the early weeks of getting these bets organized and placed.</p>

  <h3>[5.1.3 League Hosting, Final Scoring, and Schedule Generation]</h3>
  <p>The ACT, or DIE. Dynasty League will be hosted on sleeper.app. Head to head scoring will be determined each week by the stats from that website. From time to time, the NFL may go back and change the scoring of certain plays later in the week. Sleeper app gives the commissioner the option to make these scores retroactive. However, to maintain a sense of fairness and avoid confusion in the league, all head-to-head scoring will be resolved as of Tuesday at noon Eastern. Any scoring changes that come out from the NFL after that time will not be applied to the league. The schedule each year will be generated by the hosting site.</p>

  <h2>[6.0 Offseason Activities]</h2>
  <p>Owners are strongly encouraged to maintain their current contact information as part of the league software. Please make sure to include your name, phone number and email address in the event that another owner needs to reach you during the off season. You should expect to be contacted in June/July with information about the year’s annual draft. Owners are strongly encouraged to participate in and be active in the Slack Chat and occasionally make guest appearances on the league podcast.</p>

  <h3>[6.1 Rule Changes]</h3>
  <p>Dynasty leagues last a long time so they need to evolve like anything else. Rule changes will be proposed and voted on in the off season (prior to start of annual draft).  An 8/12 vote will be needed for scoring, lineup, and roster related changes since they can substantially impact how specific owners build their teams.  Such matters will take effect one year beyond the year they are voted in, to allow the league time to adjust roster construction. A 6/12 vote for most other league decisions will be required. These other rules will go into immediate effect. The executive committee will determine whether rule changes require 6 or 8 votes to pass. Anyone with ideas for rule changes can send a formal rule change with detailed explanation to the commissioner throughout the year. These proposed changes will be compiled and voted on in the offseason – sometime in close proximity to the NFL Superbowl. Approved rule changes will be implemented immediately. If you have a rule proposal and submit it during the season it is your responsibility to also propose it officially during the rule proposal period of the off-season. The commissioner and exec board will make every effort to remember proposed rule changes throughout the year, but are not responsible for these proposals getting added to the formal docket vote for proposed rule changes. A rule change that is passed, can not be voted on again (to reverse the rule) the following season; however, it can be revisited after the next season. Any rule proposals that fail to pass can be re-proposed the following season.</p>

  <h3>[6.2 League Duration]</h3>
  <p>Since this is a dynasty league, the expectation is that this league will be played every year essentially forever. Obviously this only means that the league will continue as long as a majority of players want to continue. If an owner for any reason would like to quit, please email the Executive Committee directly so that a replacement owner can be found in a timely fashion. If a single team quits the league their team will be offered to the replacement owner in its entirety. If two or more owners quit in the same year, the orphaned teams will be combined into a separate player pool and there will be an “expansion team” draft in which the new owners will select their teams out of this smaller, separate player pool.</p>
  <p>Hopefully this kind of thing does not happen, but the provision is in place in case it does.</p>

  <h3>[6.3 Dispersal Draft]</h3>
  <p>An optional dispersal draft will be offered each off-season. Teams who opt-into the dispersal draft will have all of their assets: players, draft picks, players they own devy rights to into a single draft pool. All teams who have opted in will then participate in a draft including all of the players, picks, and devy in this pool. No team is required to participate in the dispersal draft. This optional dispersal draft will allow owners and teams who have grown discouraged with their team to have a “second chance”.</p>
  <p>Anyone who would like to elect to participate in the dispersal draft should notify the commissioner that they would like to formally request participation in the dispersal draft. The commissioner / executive board will send out requests to see if any other owners are interested in the dispersal draft prior to thes season. Should there be at least 2 teams interested in participating in a dispersal draft, the commissioner will set a time and day to hold the dispersal draft. The draft will be a snake draft and the draft will be ordered with better record teams picking earlier. To clarify, in the event we have a dispersal draft and have a new owners dispersal draft in a single off-season (See 6.2 bottom of section) these two dispersals will be held separately. Once the new owners dispersal draft occurs then those team managers/owners will have the opportunity to participate in the larger league dispersal draft.</p>

  <p>Thank You for joining the ACT, or DIE Dynasty League and Good Luck this year!</p>
