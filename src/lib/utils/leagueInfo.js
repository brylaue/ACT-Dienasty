Welcome to the ACT, or DIE. Dynasty League. This is a 12-team league that was formed mid-season in
2018 for our more dedicated fantasy football playing friends as a place to compete against each other in
a challenging and long-term setting. This is a dynasty league, meaning that owners will keep ALL the
players on their team from year to year. This league is considered a prize money league, and all owners
are expected to pay their league fee before the league fee deadline (start of the NFL regular season).
There may be a late fee assessed after the deadline. This league is designed to be a competitive league
between friends but is not a cut-throat league where anything goes. The rules described below are
designed to act as a guideline for overall league play, and any disputes will be determined by the
executive committee of the league. Please remember that the overall goal of this league is to have fun
and enjoy the game of football with your friends. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not
hesitate to ask.
